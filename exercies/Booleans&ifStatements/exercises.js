// Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
// Create a variable age and save a personâ€™s age inside.
// Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.
// Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.
// Try changing the age variable to display different messages.
